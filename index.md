# PROJECTS

### » [Star Gazer](https://github.com/Muellegr/Star_Gazer)
Ongoing fall-2020 project.
A handheld device that when pointed at a star or constellation, will display information about it.

Goal is to gain experiance with picking, flashing, and using a microcontroller from scratch.  
Other goals are using sensitive and small components such as gyrometers and magnometers for sensor information.

#### » Shoulder Bluetooth Radio
I like do do workouts on a bike around the local trails.  Some of these may end up being an hour of hard work going uphill.  In silence.  
This project was to create a small speaker connected to an ESP32 microcontroller, which would be connected to my phone over bluetooth.
This was my first PCB and done without any prior experiance.
Todo
Project failed - PCB was a success, however not designing the case made it easy to put down and forget about.
